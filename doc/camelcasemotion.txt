DESCRIPTION					 *camelcasemotion-description*

Vim provides many built-in motions, e.g. to move to the next word, or end of
the current word. Most programming languages use either CamelCase
("anIdentifier") or underscore_notation ("an_identifier") naming conventions
for identifiers. The best way to navigate inside those identifiers using Vim
built-in motions is the [count]f{char} motion, i.e. f{uppercase-char} or f_,
respectively. But we can make this easier: 

This script defines motions|,w|,|,b| and|,e|(similar to |w|,|b|,|e|), which do
not move word-wise (forward/backward), but Camel-wise; i.e. to word boundaries
and uppercase letters. The motions also work on underscore notation, where
words are delimited by underscore ('_') characters. From here on, both
CamelCase and underscore_notation entities are referred to as "words" (in
double quotes). Just like with the regular motions, a [count] can be prepended
to move over multiple "words" at once. Outside of "words" (e.g. in non-keyword
characters like // or ;), the new motions move just like the regular motions. 

Vim provides a built-in|iw|text object called 'inner word', which works in
operator-pending and visual mode. Analog to that, this script defines inner
"word" motions |i,w|,|i,b| and|i,e|, which select the "word" (or multiple
"words" if a [count] is given) where the cursor is located. 

==============================================================================
USAGE						       *camelcasemotion-usage*
								*,w* *,b* *,e*
Use the new motions|,w|,|,b| and|,e| in normal mode, operator-pending mode
(cp.|operator|), and visual mode. For example, type 'bc,w' to change 'Camel'
in 'CamelCase' to something else. 


EXAMPLE: motions
Given the following CamelCase identifiers in a source code fragment:
    set Script31337PathAndNameWithoutExtension11=%~dpn0 ~
    set Script31337PathANDNameWITHOUTExtension11=%~dpn0 ~
and the corresponding identifiers in underscore_notation:
    set script_31337_path_and_name_without_extension_11=%~dpn0 ~
    set SCRIPT_31337_PATH_AND_NAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION_11=%~dpn0 ~

,w moves to ([x] is cursor position): [s]et, [s]cript, [3]1337, [p]ath,
    [a]nd, [n]ame, [w]ithout, [e]xtension, [1]1, [d]pn0, dpn[0], [s]et
,b moves to: [d]pn0, [1]1, [e]xtension, [w]ithout, ...
,e moves to: se[t], scrip[t], 3133[7], pat[h], an[d], nam[e], withou[t],
    extensio[n], 1[1], dpn[0]


EXAMPLE: inner motions
Given the following identifier, with the cursor positioned at [x]:
    script_31337_path_and_na[m]e_without_extension_11 ~

v3i,w selects script_31337_path_and_[name_without_extension_]11
v3i,b selects script_31337_[path_and_name]_without_extension_11
v3i,e selects script_31337_path_and_[name_without_extension]_11
Instead of visual mode, you can also use c3i,w to change, d3i,w to delete,
gU3i,w to upper-case, and so on.

INSTALLATION					*camelcasemotion-installation*

This script is packaged as a|vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the|:UseVimball|command. >
    vim camelcasemotion.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the|:RmVimball|command. 

DEPENDENCIES					*camelcasemotion-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				       *camelcasemotion-configuration*

If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>CamelCaseMotion_? mapping targets _before_ sourcing this script (e.g. in
your|vimrc|).  

EXAMPLE: Replace the default|w|,|b| and|e| mappings instead of defining
additional mappings|,w|,|,b| and|,e|: >
    map <silent> w <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_w
    map <silent> b <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_b
    map <silent> e <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_e
    sunmap w
    sunmap b
    sunmap e

EXAMPLE: Replace default|iw|text-object and define|ib|and |ie|motions: >
    omap <silent> iw <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_iw
    xmap <silent> iw <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_iw
    omap <silent> ib <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_ib
    xmap <silent> ib <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_ib
    omap <silent> ie <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_ie
    xmap <silent> ie <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_ie

==============================================================================
KNOWN PROBLEMS				      *camelcasemotion-known-problems*

- A degenerate CamelCaseWord containing '\U\u\d' (e.g. "MaP1Roblem") confuses
  the operator-pending and visual mode ,e mapping if 'selection' is not set to
  "exclusive". It'll skip "P" and select "P1" in one step. As a workaround,
  use ',w' instead of ',e'; those two mappings have the same effect inside
  CamelCaseWords, anyway. 
- The operator-pending and visual mode ,e mapping doesn't work properly when
  it reaches the end of the buffer; the final character of the moved-over
  "word" remains. As a workaround, use the default 'e' motion instead of ',e'. 
- When the Vim setting 'selection' is not set to "exclusive", a
  forward-backward combination in visual mode (e.g. 'v,w,b') selects one
  additional character to the left, instead of only the character where the
  motion started. Likewise, extension of the visual selection from the front
  end is off by one additional character.

HISTORY						     *camelcasemotion-history*

1.50	05-May-2009
- Do not create mappings for select mode; according to|Select-mode|, printable
  character commands should delete the selection and insert the typed
  characters. Now using :xmap to only target visual mode. 
- Moved functions from plugin to separate autoload script. 
- Split off documentation into separate help file. 

1.40	30-Jun-2008
BF: Now using :normal! to be independent from any user mappings. Thanks to
Neil Walker for the patch.

1.40	19-May-2008
BF: Wrong forward motion stop at the second digit if a word starts with
multiple numbers (e.g. 1234.56789). Thanks to Wasim Ahmed for reporting this.

1.40	24-Apr-2008
ENH: Added inner "word" text objects 'i,w' etc. that work analoguous to the
built-in |iw| text object. Thanks to David Kotchan for this suggestion.

1.30	20-Apr-2008
The motions now also stop at non-keyword boundaries, just like the regular
motions. This has no effect inside a CamelCaseWord or inside
underscore_notation, but it makes the motions behave like the regular motions
(which is important if you replace the default motions). Thanks to Mun Johl
for reporting this. 

1.30	09-Apr-2008
- Allowing users to use mappings different than ,w ,b ,e by defining
  <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_? target mappings. This can even be used to replace
  the default 'w', 'b' and 'e' mappings, as suggested by Mun Johl.
- Now requires VIM 7.0 or higher. 

1.20	29-May-2007
ENH: The visual mode motions now also (mostly) work with the (default) setting
'set selection=inclusive', instead of selecting one character too much. 

1.10	28-May-2007
Incorporated major improvements and simplifications done by Joseph Barker. 

1.00	22-May-2007
First published version. 

0.01	11-Oct-2005
Started development based on vimtip #1016 by Anthony Van Ham.
