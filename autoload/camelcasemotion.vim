		" The difference between normal mode, operator-pending and visual

		" selected. This is done by appending a 'l' motion after the

		" at the end of the line (i.e. when the moved-over "word" is at
		" the end of the line) when the 'l' motion is allowed to move
		" over to the next line. Thus, the 'l' motion is added
		" temporarily to the global 'whichwrap' setting. 
		" Without this, the motion would leave out the last character in
		" the line. I've also experimented with temporarily setting
		" "set virtualedit=onemore" , but that didn't work.
